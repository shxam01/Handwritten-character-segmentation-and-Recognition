# HANDWRITTEN-CHARACTER-SEGMENTATION-AND-RECOGNITION         EXPLORATORY PROJECT 2021 
This module has been developed using deep learning and convolutional neural networks along with the help of OpenCv for letter segmentation. It can be used to recognize handwritten characters consisting of different letters as well as numbers. The model was trained on Google Colab using the EMINST by_class dataset in the form of a csv file. The dataset was modified to remove similar characters such as X and x. The model was trained to achieve a validation accuracy of 97% and a test accuracy of 92%.

## Special features of this model - 
The special features of this model include :-  
  1. This model can recognize characters consisting of letters and numbers rotated at a max. angle of 45 deg.
  2. It can be also used for characters consisting of lots of noise in the form of lines and dots.
  3. Can detect characters having letters of variable thickness and size
  
## Characters - 
The characters on which the model was trained are given in the file characters.txt.
